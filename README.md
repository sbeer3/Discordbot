Discordbot Source Code
Hello! If you are reading this, you are interested in the sourcecode for my discordbot! 

Let me just rundown where you will find all that you need to know!

Commands: This folder includes individually coded commands that the bot can run on a server, each with their own purpose.
Bot.js: this is the main file for the bot, this is where most of the main functionality occurs, including the youtube player.
Website Files: These files are used primarily by Glitch.com, the service I am using to host the webpage of (www.fembot.xyz).
