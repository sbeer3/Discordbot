Discordbot Source Code
Hello! If you are reading this, you are interested in the sourcecode for my discordbot! 

Let me just rundown where you will find all that you need to know!

Commands: This folder includes individually coded commands that the bot can run on a server, each with their own purpose.
Bot.js: this is the main file for the bot, this is where most of the main functionality occurs, including the youtube player.
Website Files: These files are used primarily by Glitch.com, as well as the extra .JSON files, those are being used by glitch and the webpage I am going to build in the future

In bot.js, at the bottom I have referenced some of the APIs I used in this project, and some of the websites I referenced for help.

The goal in my discord bot is to just make a fun project for personal use, I have no hope in gaining anything but experience from this!
